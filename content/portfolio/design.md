	Desc = 'This project explored the different elements and principles of art through a specific assignment for each. I chose here to showcase my “color” assignment, which was my personal favorite. The colors chosen for this project was inspired from the colors of Autumn, through which I hoped to impart a sense of warmth and a velvety feeling. While technically simple, I had to make sure to keep in mind important base concepts, such as composition and balance throughout the piece.'

	Desc = 'The digital illustration project was made up of many different assignments combined, all meant to bolster our digital illustration abilities, from ideation to production. This featured drawing is created in the likeness of Obama, who I admire for his speech skills and charismatic character. One of my other favorite pieces in this collection is the one I made for a monster. For that, I took heavy inspiration from the goopy/slime kind of art made of monsters from popular culture. I tried to make it look cute and artistic through use of color and texture.'

	Desc = 'This Movie Poster project was about exploring different ideas in movie poster design, such as identifying and conveying central idea of the movie. I chose a very minimalistic approach to my poster, which was inspired by my research of other movie posters. I had chosen Thor: Ragnarok for this artwork since it was a recent movie that I had watched that stuck on my mind.'

The golden ratio is an incredibly prevalent concept that instills a sense of balance and visual unity in an artwork. We utilized the golden spiral and circles from the fibonacci sequence. These principles and vector art helped me create this project.'

From historical examples I’ve seen blue and red used as prominent colors within propaganda posters, so I tried to take take inspiration from the past and add a modern twist, adding some more arguably strange and jarring colors.'

In my case I worked with Claire, who likes this kind of pink, artistic look. To create this artwork, I created custom typography within Illustrator and layered it on top of a simple shape and a stock rose photo.'

	Desc = 'For the Cityguide, I did not exactly follow what was requested. Mr. Brodhead, who was my client for this project, explained why he believed that a language guide meant to inform people of some useful phrases in Korean can be beneficial, and I thought it had great potential in terms of design and interactive experience, so I went forward with the idea. Using the interactive features of InDesign, I was able to animate and include audio files of the words in the language making the interactive feature far more important than a mere gimmick.'

In our other projects, we were given more creative reign and freedom, but this kind of limiting project also encourages us to express our own creative ideas in different ways. While everyone used displacement maps, word clouds, and a base photo, I was able to do something different with color and composition.'

	Desc = 'The animated rotoscpe project was a quick one that consisted of us filming ourselves doing a simple action and tracing it within photoshop. Despite photoshop not being the best tool for animation, the final result was rather acceptable. A challenge in photoshop is not just making each individual frame look good, but make the entire animation fluid in context. In Photoshop, where it is difficult to look at adjacent frames, it was more difficult to create the animation and required flipping back and forth and additional work to make sure the whole piece had unity.'

	Desc = 'The alphabet project was inspiried from a specific designer who created creative designs from something ultimately as simple as letters. I wanted to do something slightly different, so I incorporated more colors. I do not know what this aesthetic is called, but I wanted to make sure to use very bold, strong colors. The last one was very different and was more experimental compared to my other designs.'
