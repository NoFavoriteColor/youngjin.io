# Portfolio

If I were to summarize my work, I would say it is a blend of technology and art. A particular product cannot exist on one of those legs alone. My Illustrator and InDesign projects, for example, often require math, precision, and effective use of technology; my programming work is often guided by my sense of aesthetic, both in the final result (css) and in the code base.

Looking back at how I started in my path, I realize that the reason I had gotten into art and design was that my proficiency with computers meant I was also quick to understand Photoshop and Illustrator. I've grew talent in both fields in similar ways too: by helping other people and building up experience.

<br />
This connection between art and technology has become even more apparent to me after assembling this portfolio. I found it incredibly difficult to decide if certain projects was really 'Art' or 'Programming,' and I had to compromise to be able to lay things into nice sections. Nevertheless, I hope that the reader would appreciate my effort and my work, if they have even read this far.
